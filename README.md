# Offensive and Defensive Cybersecurity challenges - A.Y. 2024-2025

This repository contains my solutions for **CTF challenges** proposed during the course "Offensive and Defensive Cybersecurity" offered at Politecnico di Milano. 

Challenges are divided into categories, as presented in class. 
Each challenge directory includes:

- **Executable**: original challenge file or binary.
- **Solution Overview**: a brief explanation of the techniques and methods used to capture the flag.
- **Writeup**.

The objective of the challenges is to find the flag, which is a string that follows the format `FLAG{...}`.
